<h3><b>What is Puravive?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Puravive is a weight loss supplement that claims to boost weight loss by targeting the root cause of weight gain. It is formulated with a blend of 8 tropical ingredients and plants, sourced from Da Bac Island in Vietnam, where there are no cases of obesity.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the ingredients are backed by science to be helpful in weight loss, with no side effects. Puravive is a weight loss supplement built specifically to target brown adipose tissues (BAT) and helps the body combat white fat to help lose the unhealthy fat in the body. Moreover, Puravive is also said to support cardiovascular health, stress, inflammation, and more.</span>
<h3><b>The science behind the working of Puravive</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two distinct types of fat tissues in the body â€“ brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. Puravive works by targeting the brown adipose tissues in the body. According to research, it has been shown that people who are overweight have low levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body, while lean people have high levels of brown adipose tissue. Brown adipose tissues play a major role in weight gain. It burns more calories than white adipose tissues (white fat) which, on the other hand, is associated with weight gain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consuming one capsule of Puravive daily purportedly helps to target the low levels of brown adipose tissues in the body, which significantly burns many more calories than white adipose tissues (white fat). Puravive helps with the 'browning' of your adipose tissues, which helps to deliver powerful weight loss results.</span>
